# ELEC5470 Convex Optimization

<p align="justify">This is a personal learning log and playground of Convex Optimization. Some of the content here was the learning material of mine when taking ELEC5470, which was taught by Dr. Xuanyu Cai from Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The syllabus of the course follows strictly with the textbook Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe; I also find it closely in line with Stanford's graduate course EE365A.</p>

<p align="justify">Seprated by several folders, this repo contains all the conducted homework, midterm tests, and mini-project, while some trial code will also be included here. I hope the shared documents could someday be other learners' reference material when doing this subject. Enjoy :)</p>
