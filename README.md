# ELEC5470 Convex Optimization
This is a personal learning log of course ELEC5470 on Convex Optimization taught by Dr. Xuanyu Cai from Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The syllabus of the course follows strictly with the textbook Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe; I also find it closely in line with Stanford's graduate course EE365A.

Seprated by several folders, this repo contains all the conducted homework, midterm tests, and mini-project. I hope the shared documents could someday be other learners' reference material when doing this subject. Enjoy :)
